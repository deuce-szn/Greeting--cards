The "Greeting Cards Application" is a React project that utilizes Vite and Tailwind CSS to create and display dynamic greeting cards. The aim was to get extensive experience in constructing reusable components, transmitting data via props, and proficiently applying styles using a utility-first CSS framework. This assignment instructed me on establishing a contemporary React application using Vite, developing useful and modular components, and augmenting them with responsive and interactive styles with Tailwind. It provided me with invaluable expertise in debugging, structuring a scalable program, and ensuring consistency of the user experience across devices. It really helped me understand React and CSS frameworks and how to tie together theoretical principles to concrete implementation.
